**Snake Game - Python Project üêç**

Welcome to Snake Game, a Python-based project where you can enjoy the classic snake game, enhanced with modern features like high scores and responsive gameplay. 
This project was built using the turtle module and follows an object-oriented programming approach.

**Features**
- Dynamic Gameplay: Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction as it navigates the screen.
- Collision Detection:
    The snake grows when it "eats" food.
    The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- Score Tracking:
    Keep track of your current score and high score.
    High scores are saved to a data.txt file, so they persist between sessions.
- Modular Code Design: The game logic is split into reusable classes:
    Snake: Handles snake movement and growth.
    Food: Manages food appearance and placement.
    Scoreboard: Displays and updates scores.

**Technologies Used**
- Python Modules:
    turtle: Core graphics for gameplay.
    random: For generating random food positions.
    time: To control the speed of the snake.
- Object-Oriented Design:
    Classes (Snake, Food, Scoreboard) ensure modular, reusable code.
